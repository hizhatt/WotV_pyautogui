# WotV_pyautogui
## Basic info
This is based on pyautogui, as the name suggest. This code is basically like a bot that will auto click the menus in a WotV Multi battle grind. It scans the screen for the buttons and click it for you, so you don't have to.


## Major inconveniences:
- Manual .png setup
  - You have to setup the .png files manually the first time and every time the game window changes sizes. ~~Sometimes even when no windows size change, it loses it's detection. Have to redo again.~~
- No GUI
- No auto join room
  - You have to manually join rooms when the room disbands or lost connection or etc.

## Feature highlight
- This program will write to a text file (BattleLog.txt) the datetime and number of cycle of the Multi quest that you've completed. Great for tracking efficiency.
